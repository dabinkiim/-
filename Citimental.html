    <img id="main-img" src="c/citimental_logo.png" width="60%"><br>
    <span class="small-text">Team Project : Dabin Kim, Chawon Jeon, Sunyong Mun, Jihyun Seo.<br>
      The ‘Ci·ti·men·tal’ was conducted by team <在在所所> with the support of the Hongik university innovation support project.<br> </span>

    <br> ‘Ci·ti·men·tal’ is about space, and at the same time, it’s about people. Through a space called “home,” which
    shares all our life forms, we want to face social realities from various perspectives. <br><br>

    ‘Ci·ti·men·tal’ consists of volume one that contains four speakers' personal stories about space and volume
    two that extend the story from an administrative, family and sociological perspective. ‘Ci·ti·men·tal’ is basically
    "urban sentiment," which refers to the urban space in which speakers in their 20s live in a powerful way with
    individual sentiment.<br>
    Project participants recognized the emergence of a new generation after the 'Apartment Kid'(Born in 60-70s
    in korea, near my parent generations who first starts to live in apartment) from the perspective of this 'urban
    sentiment' and sought to form a space discourse for the new generation through the process of creating the book based on empathy.
